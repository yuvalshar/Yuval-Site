    <h2 id="professionalInput">I will start from the end, my dream is to become the CEO
        of a startup that I will establish, in the field of software. <br> <br>
        My way to get there for me is to be accepted into <br> the
        software engineering major in high school,<br> <br>
        then to serve in the technology unit 8200, and eventually to
        establish a successful startup that is <br> based mainly on
        cloud and AI intelligence technologies.
        in addition to data and machine learning.</h2>
