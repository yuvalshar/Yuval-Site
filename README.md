# Personal Portfolio Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This project is a creative representation of who I am, developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides an interactive experience to learn about my background, interests, and childhood.

## Project Structure

### Dashboard (Home Page)
The first page of the project is the Dashboard. Here, you'll find a picture of me along with a brief introduction. The Dashboard includes three buttons:
- **Studies**: Click this to read about my academic journey.
- **Professional**: Discover my professional experiences and aspirations.
- **Leisure**: Learn about my hobbies and how I spend my free time.

Each button reveals a section with detailed paragraphs about the respective topic. There's also a button to navigate to the second page.

### Page Two: The Canvas Experience
The second page is a dynamic canvas where you control a character using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The background features a picture of me with my father when I was very young. 

As you move the character, you'll encounter three childhood books that were significant to me, like "The Lion Who Loved Strawberries", along with two simple math puzzles I loved as a kid. When you collide with these items, prompts appear:
- For books, you'll learn why they were meaningful to me.
- For puzzles, you'll need to solve them correctly before continuing.

Once all the items are collected, a "Game Over" screen will appear with a button to proceed to the third page.

### Page Three: The Future
The third page is still under development but is intended to be the most amazing creation I've ever made. It's going to be a significant leap forward in my web development journey, so stay tuned!

## Technologies Used
