    <h2 id="professionalInput">I will start from the end, my dream is to become the CEO
        of a startup that I will establish, in the field of software. <br> <br>
        My way to get there for me is to be accepted into <br> the
        software engineering major in high school,<br> <br>
        then to serve in the technology unit 8200, and eventually to
        establish a successful startup that is <br> based mainly on
        cloud and AI intelligence technologies.
        in addition to data and machine learning.</h2>

    <h2 id="leisureInput">In my free time I combine many interests. <br>
        I play violin and piano, participate in two <br> orchestras and a chamber ensemble. <br>
        In addition I take part in the school's music major. I also play tennis, three times a week. <br> <br>
        In the remaining time I really like to study mathematics independently, and now<br>
        I'm preparing for matriculation. <br> <br>
        I program in the Java Script language and develop websites in HTML & CSS <br>
        with the help of Java Script algorithms. <br>
        Of course I always like to keep up to date <br>
        with technology and the high-tech world, especially with happenings in companies <br>
        like Apple and Google. In addition to <br>
        interesting new technologies such as the Ai. <br></h2>

    <h2 id="studiesInput">I have always had good grades. <br>
        in this certificate, I managed to reach an average of 95 and produce a certificate of excellence. <br> <br>
        My favorite subject is mathematics and I also invest in it in my free time. <br>
        In the 10th grade, I will take the matriculation exam in mathematics. <br>
        Immediately after, I will start a degree in computer science. <br> <br>
        In high school, I plan to major in software engineering and expend in physics, computer science, math, and English.
